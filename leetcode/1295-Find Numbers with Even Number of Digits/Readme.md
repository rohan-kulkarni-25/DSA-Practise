# Logic

<h2>

- We are given an array with integers we need to loop through the array 
- Perform a operation on each element that is nums[i]
- On this we need to find the number of digits in this number for that we can divide the number by 10 untill it's 0 
- We can use while loop for this and count the number of times the while loop is getting executed
- And if the count of while loop is even then the orignal count will increase by 1 which we need to return as output.
